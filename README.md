  <li>Presentation: My presentation and nav buttons to quickly get to your desired section</li>
  <li>Skills: There is a component that renders a different image of a burger depending on where on the burger the cursor hovers or clicks. I built one div with the burger nested inside, that has a sibling div(position: absolute, same height and width as the img) with 3 child divs each taking up about one third of that div's height. Those three divs had event listeners that triggered state change in React, which rendered a new burger img and skills et. Each skills set had to be a different component to trigger the animation</li>

  <li>About: Information about me, nothing new to reveal</li>
